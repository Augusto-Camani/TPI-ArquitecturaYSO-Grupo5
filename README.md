1-First of all you need to go to this git hub repository.

2-Once you are here, there are two ways to get our docker container app.

3-The first way is to got to go to the code part. If you're already there, then click on the green button that says "CODE". Select the HTTPS protocol and download the .zip file.

4-If you dowload the .zip file and you've got docker and docker-compose installed on your PC. You must go to the directory where it was downloaded and decompress the file in a folder you want to hold the archives.

5-If you've didn't have docker or docker-compose installed, you must search on the DOCKER web site the tips for installation on your OS distribution, and install them on your own PC.

6-Then open a CMD terminal if you're on WINDOWS or a Terminal if you are in MacOS or Linux.

7-Then press the command: chmod +xwr "Name of the file" to give read , write and execute permissions.

8-After that you should write the "docker-compose up -d" command on terminal to run the image container in detach mode. It will execute, run and install by itself.

9-Then write "docker ps -a" to assure that the container is running. If it is running then copy the ports and paste it on your personal browser. It will open our HTML file and show you our web-app.

10-By the other hand, you can copy the https link on the green "Code" button. Open a terminal and downlaod it using GIT tool.

11-Open a folder and press right click on the screen. Once the Terminal is opened, enter the: "git init" command. It will run and create a local repository. Then write "git clone" command plus the https.link you've copied earlier. Press enter and wait until the process is finished.

12-When the process is finished you can do "8" and "9".
